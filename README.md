Gui that is far from pretty but done in python nothing special

To be able to get this you will need to download Git to your machine here is the link:
                  https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once installed and you will need to clone the repo from GitHub here is the link:
          https://github.com/K1ngDiZzY/groupPy.git

Might have to be on the Gits CLI to pull down the repo unless you have it configured already to run in your normal CLI

command:

git clone https://github.com/K1ngDiZzY/groupPy.git
    
The "application" runs out of the app folder main.pyw is the file you want to make a short cut
